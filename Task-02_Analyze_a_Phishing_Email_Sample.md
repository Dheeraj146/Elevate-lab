## 1. Sample Phishing Email
A phishing email was obtained for educational purposes. The message claimed to be from Netflix and warned the recipient of suspicious activity that had resulted in a suspended account.
The email prompted the recipient to click a link to "verify billing information."

<pre>Subject: Action Required: Your Netflix Account Has Been Suspended

From: Netflix Support support@netflix-billing.com
To: john.doe@gmail.com

Dear Customer,

We noticed suspicious activity on your Netflix account and have temporarily suspended your membership for your security.

To restore full access, please verify your billing information:

üëâ Click here to verify your account

If you do not complete the verification within 24 hours, your account will be permanently locked.

Thank you for being a valued member of Netflix.

Sincerely,
Netflix Billing Department
Netflix Inc.</pre>

2. Examination of Sender's Email Address
   
Claimed Sender: Netflix Support support@netflix-billing.com

The domain netflix-billing.com is not an official Netflix domain.

This is a spoofed address meant to mimic legitimate communication.

üîç Red Flag: Domain looks official but is not registered to Netflix.
