## Recommendations
‚úÖ Patch Apache to a secure version (‚â• 2.4.51).

‚úÖ Upgrade OpenSSH to eliminate user enumeration flaws.

‚úÖ Configure SMB Signing to prevent MITM attacks.

‚úÖ Restrict Port Access using a firewall (e.g., UFW or Windows Defender Firewall).

‚úÖ Disable Unused Services, like IPP or NetBIOS if not needed.
